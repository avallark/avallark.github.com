title: "Programmers" are undervalued
author: Abdul Bijur Vallarkodath

I am part of IT management in one of the top business schools in the world. We are undergoing an IT organizational change that has left us with just 2 real programmers in a team of 8. Despite my efforts to have a team of programmers who could do a variety of things, management is not keen on having programmers. They do not see the value!
